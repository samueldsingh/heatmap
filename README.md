# Heatmap

Heatmaps can be used to display large amounts of points in a way that is visually engaging 
and encourages your audience to explore your map. To create this heatmap you need a mapbox
account and an access token. We'll be using the GeoJSON file of street trees in the city of 
Pittsburgh from the [Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center](http://www.wprdc.org/) file of street trees in 
the city of Pittsburgh from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center.

useful for showing the density of points over an area. This type of heatmap does not visualize 
density by aggregating features within a set of boundaries in the way a choropleth map does, 
but instead displays a continuous gradient between points.
